The due date for this is the same as the original due date for the assignment (**May 2nd at 11:59 p.m.**). 

The due date for the report is now the day of the scheduled final exam for this course (**May 9th at 11:59 p.m**).

## Overview  

For this final assignment, you will synthesize the work completed in Parts 1 and 2 into a polished deliverable that communicates your findings effectively. This assignment has **two components**:  

1. **A Quarto RevealJS Presentation**: A lightning talk summarizing your project, findings, and policy implications.  
2. **A Final Written Report**: A detailed document that provides a comprehensive overview of your analysis, results, and recommendations.  

Together, these components should demonstrate your ability to apply data analysis skills to answer a question relevant to decision-making in a real-world context.  

## Component 1: RevealJS Presentation (due May 2nd) 

You will create a **5 minute presentation** using Quarto's RevealJS slide deck format. The goal of the presentation is to provide a concise and engaging summary of your project.  

**Here is a rough outline for your presentation**:  
- **Slide 1**: Title slide with project title, group member names, and date.  
- **Slide 2**: Introduction of your research question and its importance.  
- **Slide 3**: Overview of your data, including the source and key variables.  
- **Slides 4 - 5**: Key results, supported by 1–2 visuals (e.g., plots or tables).  
- **Slide 6**: Summary of findings and policy implications.  

**Tips**:  
- Use visuals to make your presentation engaging and accessible.  
- Keep text minimal—focus on high-level points and key insights.  
- Practice your timing to stay within the 5 minute limit.  
- You can add a few more slides if needed, but only if it still allows you to stay within the time limit.

**Submission Instructions**:  
- Upload your RevealJS presentation to [Quarto Pub](https://quartopub.com/) and share the link to the presentation on Discord.
- Record your presentation using a screen recording tool (e.g., Zoom, Vimeo) and post the link to the recording to Discord.
- Submit the QMD file for the presentation to Blackboard.

## Component 2: Final Written Report (due May 9th)  

The final report should be a **3–5 page policy memo** or technical report that provides a detailed narrative of your project. The memo should build upon the work from Parts 1 and 2, integrating your research question, hypotheses, analysis, and conclusions.  

**Your report should include**:  

1. **Introduction**:  
   - Clearly state your research question and why it is important.  
   - Provide background context, citing relevant literature or examples.  

2. **Data and Methodology**:  
   - Describe your data sources and key variables (outcome and explanatory).  
   - Justify your choice of analytical approach, including the methods used (e.g., regression, hypothesis testing).  

3. **Analysis and Results**:  
   - Present your findings, supported by tables, plots, or statistical results.  
   - Include at least one visualization of your results (e.g., regression plot, histogram).  

4. **Discussion**:  
   - Interpret your results in the context of your research question and hypotheses.  
   - Discuss the statistical significance and implications of your findings.  

5. **Policy Implications**:  
   - Summarize how your findings inform policy or decision-making in your chosen area.  
   - Propose actionable recommendations based on your analysis.  

6. **Conclusion**:  
   - Provide a clear and concise answer to your research question.  
   - Reflect briefly on the limitations of your analysis and potential next steps.  

**Submission Instructions**:  
- Render your report in **HTML** format and upload it to Quarto Pub.
