Assignment due dates are posted in the ‚Äúweekly materials‚Äù page for the week that they are due. The final component of the final project is due at 11:59 p.m. on the date of the scheduled final. (Note that that there is no final exam for this course. This is just the due date for the Tableau assignment).\nLate assignments will be accepted with a standard penalty of three percentage points per day that they are turned in after the official due date. No exceptions will be made to this policy.\nIf you are having a personal or medical emergency and are wondering what to do, start by referencing this FAQ published by GW Student Life. Or just reach out to the CARE Team at gwcares@gwu.edu. For further information about different types of support available to you, see the course support page.\nWhile I will always try to be a source of support to my students, please note that for privacy reasons, the Provost has asked that faculty do not attempt to verify personal or medical emergencies themselves.\n\n\nMake-ups\nThere are no makeups. Please see the late assignments policy above.\n\n\nAttendance\nThis is an in-person class and you are expected to attend. While there is no formal attendance requirement, it is a proven fact that students who attend class tend to perform better on exams and assignments. Also, the instructor will not provide ‚Äúmakeup sessions‚Äù to go over material that was missed due to absence.\n\n\nGrading scale\n\n\n\nRange\nLetter Grade\n\n\n\n\n94-100\nA\n\n\n90-93\nA-\n\n\n87-89\nB+\n\n\n84-86\nB\n\n\n80-83\nB-\n\n\n77-79\nC+\n\n\n74-76\nC\n\n\n70-73\nC-\n\n\n67-69\nD+\n\n\n64-66\nD\n\n\n60-63\nD-\n\n\n&lt;59\nF\n\n\n\n\n\nClass recordings\nAll classes will be recorded. Recordings will be posted on the course Blackboard site.\n\n\nLateness\nPlease come to class on time. It is distracting to me and to other students when you enter the room late.\n\n\nLaptops and cell phones\nPlease put away your cell phones during class. It is fine to use computers to take notes, but you should refrain from checking social media and email.\n\n\nDiversity in the classroom\nWe want to make sure that everyone has an opportunity to participate in class and to get the most out of their learning experience at GW. Moreover, we all benefit from a diversity of views in the classroom. Therefore, please be respectful of other people‚Äôs views and be mindful of when others are trying to participate.\n\n\nLearning Needs\nPlease let me know if you have any special needs or learning requirements and so that I can accommodate them.\n\n\nEmail\nI try to respond to emails within 24 hours except on weekends. It is usually preferred to talk to me in person, however, either after class or during office hours.\n\n\nFood\nStudents are permitted to eat light snacks, but please refrain from bringing sugary drinks, coffee or large, odiferous meals.",

According to this code, academic dishonesty is defined as ‚Äúcheating of any kind, including misrepresenting one‚Äôs own work, taking credit for the work of others without crediting them and without appropriate authorization, and the fabrication of information.‚Äù Note that this is not a comprehensive list. Other types of academic dishonesty include providing false or misleading information in an effort to postpone an exam or to get an extension on an assignment and providing substantially similar material for a writing assignment for assignments in two different courses without the prior permission of the faculty members teaching those courses. The minimum penalty for academic dishonesty is a failing grade on the assignment in question and the maximum penalty is failure of the class. Furthermore, the violation will be reported to GW‚Äôs Office of Academic Integrity, which can impose additional penalties beyond those I may impose.\n\n\nReligious holidays\nStudents must notify faculty during the first week of the semester in which they are enrolled in the course, or as early as possible, but no later than three weeks prior to the absence, of their intention to be absent from class on their day(s) of religious observance. If the holiday falls within the first three weeks of class, the student must inform faculty in the first week of the semester. For details and policy, see ‚ÄúReligious Holidays.‚Äù\n\n\nUse of electronic materials and class recordings\nStudents are encouraged to use electronic course materials, including recorded class sessions, for private personal use in connection with their academic program of study. Electronic course materials and recorded class sessions should not be shared or used for non-course related purposes unless express permission has been granted by the instructor. Students who impermissibly share any electronic course materials are subject to discipline under the Student Code of Conduct. Please contact the instructor if you have questions regarding what constitutes permissible or impermissible use of electronic course materials and/or recorded class sessions.

For Tableau and other commonly used data analysis applications, the data need to be in long format so that each row contains values for one country or region per year and each column contains data for one variable. You also need to filter the data for the years that you want to use and select the variables that you want to work with. If you are working with more than one data set, then you have to merge the two data sets. I show you how to do all of this using data from the World Bank and V-Dem in this video.",

Then talk in detail about the visualizations you will build using these variables. The default number of visualizations is four: a line chart; a bar chart; a scatter plot and a map. What will be on the x and y axis of each visualization? How many countries or regions will you include in each? You will probably want to include a selection of countries for the bar and line charts and all of the countries for the map. Please take this opportunity to also note any problems that you had in cleaning the data and any unresolved questions about your data. It is better to admit your limitations and try to find a solution than to simply turn something in that is not going to work.\nAlong with your report, please be sure to include a .csv or Excel file with your data. I want to make sure that you are ready to produce the visualizations in Power BI. You may even want to take some time and see that the data re ready for that as well.\nDon‚Äôt overdo it. The final length of your white paper should be approximately 4-5 pages including references. No visualizations of the data are required at this time, however you are welcome to include any preliminary visualizations you have done in an appendix if you would like some feedback on them.",

You cannot download the raw data from Google, but you can use the site to visualize the data and then follow the link to the original source.\nOECD DATA provides data related to the performance of high income countries.\nOur World in Data is a good general resource for political economy data. The site is centered around blog posts but you can also search for a topic, view a visualization related to that topic and then download the data used to create it.\nStatista is a good place to look for data on more niche topics.\nUNCTADstat is the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development statistical database. It provides harmonized data on a range of topics related to economic performance, trade and statistics.\nThe UN Human Development Reports include a number of important indicators related to human development, gender and sustainable development goals (SDGs).\nVarieties of Democracy (V-DEM) provides original measures of the quality of democracy for every country dating back to the 18th century.\nWorld Bank Development Indicators (WDI) is the primary World Bank database for development data from officially-recognized international sources.\nThe World Bank DataBank provides access to dozens of additional World Bank databases on topics such as regional development, governance, education, gender and the environment.\n\nFor information on more specific resources available, see this page on the Gelman Library website.",

Follow the steps in the bar chart video to create a bar chart comparing those countries. Save your file.\nUsing those same countries, follow the steps in the line chart video to create a line chart for your countries. Save the file with your newly created line chart.\nNow select all countries and one other indicator to compare your indicator with. This should be something that you think is related to your indicator, e.g.¬†would display a positive or negative correlation with your indicator. Follow the steps in the scatter plot video to create a scatter plot for your indicator and the other variable you have chosen. Save your file with the new scatter plot visualization.\nNow follow the steps in the map video to create a map visualization for your indicator. Save the file with the visualization.\nCopy the four visualizations that you have made from the Excel files and paste them into a Word file. Make sure that each visualization has an appropriate title. Now below each visualization include a source note and write a line or two describing what you see in the visualization (e.g.¬†trends, comparisons relationships).\nSave the Word file, convert it to a .pdf, and upload it to Blackboard. Please also submit your Excel workbook along with your .pdf."

Students will begin with data visualization, learning the essential tools and principles for creating informative and impactful visual representations of data. The course then progresses to data wrangling, where students will clean, manipulate, and prepare data for analysis.\nAs the semester unfolds, students will explore web scraping techniques to gather data from online sources, followed by an examination of the ethical considerations surrounding data collection, privacy, and algorithmic bias. The course then delves into statistical modeling, introducing both linear and logistic regression, and other core methods used in predictive analytics.\nThroughout the course, various special topics, such as bootstrapping, randomization tests, or interactive web applications, will be covered, offering students a chance to explore current trends and tools in data science. The curriculum is designed to equip students with a versatile toolkit, enabling them to tackle real-world data challenges and communicate their findings effectively.",

You can choose any indicator besides life expectancy (which was used in the instructional video).\nAfter opening the file in Excel, have a look at the data. Make sure that there are not too many observations and that the file includes numbers and not text, e.g.¬†‚Äú1,000,000‚Äù as opposed to ‚Äú1M.‚Äù If there are problems with the data, try a different indicator. Make sure that there are years across the top row and country names in the columns. Think about what units the data are in., e.g.¬†thousands of dollars, millions of people, etc. so that you have a sense of what you are working with. Look for some basic trends and patterns in the data and see if they make sense to you.\nIf the data look good, create a new worksheet. Name it something like ‚Äúanalysis.‚Äù\nIn the new worksheet, choose four years to analyze that are roughly evenly spaced across the time period covered by the data. Follow the example in the video to calculate the following values: minimum, median, mean, and maximum. Next, choose a value that seems like an interesting threshold to explore. Count the number and percentage of countries above above that threshold. Put the information in a table like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nYear \\(X\\)\nYear \\(Y\\)\nYear \\(Z\\)\nYear \\(Q\\)\n\n\n\n\nMinimum\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedian\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMean\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximum\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo.¬†&gt; \\(x\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n% &gt; \\(x\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify an interesting twenty-year period to analyze Take averages of the value of your indicator over this period and place them in a separate row.\nSave your workbook.\nUpload your workbook to Blackboard."
