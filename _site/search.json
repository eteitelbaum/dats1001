By following the guidelines and expectations outlined in this syllabus policy, students can maximize the benefits of using LLMs while also demonstrating their own critical thinking, research, and programming skills.\nAs part of this course, students will have the option to use ChatGPT and other LLMs to assist in the writing of their R scripts for specific course assignments. Such tools can provide students with a starting point for their code but often the code is incomplete or error-prone. It is important to recognize that LLMs are a tool and not a substitute for critical thinking, research, or programming skills. Therefore, this syllabus policy outlines the guidelines and expectations for using LLMs in this course.\n\n\nGuidelines\nIt is also important to note that some uses of LLMs are more appropriate than others. For example, it is acceptable to use LLMs to generate boilerplate code or to help with syntax, but it is not acceptable to use an LLM to complete entire assignments or assessments. Students should use LLMs as a starting point and then modify and expand on the generated code to demonstrate their own understanding and skills.\nOne way to think of LLMs is as a tutor or classmate. What would it be appropriate to ask a tutor or classmate for help with? What would you not be permitted ask a tutor or classmate for help with?",

Students will begin with data visualization, learning the essential tools and principles for creating informative and impactful visual representations of data. The course then progresses to data wrangling, where students will clean, manipulate, and prepare data for analysis.\nAs the semester unfolds, students will explore web scraping techniques to gather data from online sources, followed by an examination of the ethical considerations surrounding data collection, privacy, and algorithmic bias. The course then delves into statistical modeling, introducing both linear and logistic regression, and other core methods used in predictive analytics.\nThroughout the course, various special topics, such as bootstrapping, randomization tests, or interactive web applications, will be covered, offering students a chance to explore current trends and tools in data science. The curriculum is designed to equip students with a versatile toolkit, enabling them to tackle real-world data challenges and communicate their findings effectively.",
