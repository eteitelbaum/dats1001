    "text": "This is a survey course in comparative political economy, a field of inquiry within the subfield of comparative politics that explores the interaction of politics and the economy. Comparative political economy is one of the most active research fields in comparative politics and is comprised of a wide range of research topics. Frequently the focus of research in comparative political economy is on how institutions influence economic outcomes. How, for example, do property rights facilitate investment and economic growth? How do different colonial legacies inhibit or promote economic performance? Sometimes, however, institutions become the dependent variable in our analysis. How does wealth influence regime stability? Or how does economic globalization affect welfare states? This course will address questions like these through an exploration of relevant literature. The syllabus emphasizes current research agendas in political economy, and its main goal is to provide students with a broad overview of contemporary debates in the field."

With the exception of the third component of the final project, assignments are due the Sunday after they are assigned. The third component of the final project is due at 11:59 p.m. on the date of the scheduled final. (Note that this does not mean that there is final exam for this course. This is just the due date for the Power BI assignment). The official due dates are posted in the ‚Äúweekly materials‚Äù page for the week that they are due.\nLate assignments will be accepted with a standard penalty of three percentage points per day that they are turned in after the official due date. No exceptions will be made to this policy.\nIf you are having a personal or medical emergency and are wondering what to do, start by referencing this FAQ published by GW Student Life. Or just reach out to the CARE Team at gwcares@gwu.edu. For further information about different types of support available to you, see the course support page.\nWhile I will always try to be a source of support to my students, please note that for privacy reasons, the Provost has asked that faculty do not attempt to verify personal or medical emergencies themselves.\n\n\nMake-ups\nThere are no makeups. Please see the late assignments policy above.\n\n\nAttendance\nThis is an in-person class and you are expected to attend. While there is no formal attendance requirement, it is a proven fact that students who attend class tend to perform better on exams and assignments. Also, the instructor will not provide ‚Äúmakeup sessions‚Äù to go over material that was missed due to absence.\n\n\nGrading scale\n\n\n\nRange\nLetter Grade\n\n\n\n\n94-100\nA\n\n\n90-93\nA-\n\n\n87-89\nB+\n\n\n84-86\nB\n\n\n80-83\nB-\n\n\n77-79\nC+\n\n\n74-76\nC\n\n\n70-73\nC-\n\n\n67-69\nD+\n\n\n64-66\nD\n\n\n60-63\nD-\n\n\n<59\nF\n\n\n\n\n\nClass recordings\nAll classes will be recorded. Recordings will be posted on the course Blackboard site.\n\n\nLateness\nPlease come to class on time. It is distracting to me and to other students when you enter the room late.\n\n\nLaptops and cell phones\nPlease put away your cell phones during class. It is fine to use computers to take notes, but you should refrain from checking social media and email.\n\n\nDiversity in the classroom\nWe want to make sure that everyone has an opportunity to participate in class and to get the most out of their learning experience at GW. Moreover, we all benefit from a diversity of views in the classroom. Therefore, please be respectful of other people‚Äôs views and be mindful of when others are trying to participate.\n\n\nLearning Needs\nPlease let me know if you have any special needs or learning requirements and so that I can accommodate them.\n\n\nEmail\nI try to respond to emails within 24 hours except on weekends. It is usually preferred to talk to me in person, however, either after class or during office hours.\n\n\nFood\nStudents are permitted to eat light snacks, but please refrain from bringing sugary drinks, coffee or large, odiferous meals."

According to this code, academic dishonesty is defined as ‚Äúcheating of any kind, including misrepresenting one‚Äôs own work, taking credit for the work of others without crediting them and without appropriate authorization, and the fabrication of information.‚Äù Note that this is not a comprehensive list. Other types of academic dishonesty include providing false or misleading information in an effort to postpone an exam or to get an extension on an assignment and providing substantially similar material for a writing assignment for assignments in two different courses without the prior permission of the faculty members teaching those courses. The minimum penalty for academic dishonesty is a failing grade on the assignment in question and the maximum penalty is failure of the class. Furthermore, the violation will be reported to GW‚Äôs Office of Academic Integrity, which can impose additional penalties beyond those I may impose.\n\n\nReligious holidays\nStudents must notify faculty during the first week of the semester in which they are enrolled in the course, or as early as possible, but no later than three weeks prior to the absence, of their intention to be absent from class on their day(s) of religious observance. If the holiday falls within the first three weeks of class, the student must inform faculty in the first week of the semester. For details and policy, see ‚ÄúReligious Holidays.‚Äù\n\n\nUse of electronic materials and class recordings\nStudents are encouraged to use electronic course materials, including recorded class sessions, for private personal use in connection with their academic program of study. Electronic course materials and recorded class sessions should not be shared or used for non-course related purposes unless express permission has been granted by the instructor. Students who impermissibly share any electronic course materials are subject to discipline under the Student Code of Conduct. Please contact the instructor if you have questions regarding what constitutes permissible or impermissible use of electronic course materials and/or recorded class sessions. Please contact Disability Support Services if you have questions or need assistance in accessing electronic course materials."
