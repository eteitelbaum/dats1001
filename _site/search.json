    "text": "This is a survey course in comparative political economy, a field of inquiry within the subfield of comparative politics that explores the interaction of politics and the economy. Comparative political economy is one of the most active research fields in comparative politics and is comprised of a wide range of research topics. Frequently the focus of research in comparative political economy is on how institutions influence economic outcomes. How, for example, do property rights facilitate investment and economic growth? How do different colonial legacies inhibit or promote economic performance? Sometimes, however, institutions become the dependent variable in our analysis. How does wealth influence regime stability? Or how does economic globalization affect welfare states? This course will address questions like these through an exploration of relevant literature. The syllabus emphasizes current research agendas in political economy, and its main goal is to provide students with a broad overview of contemporary debates in the field."

With the exception of the third component of the final project, assignments are due the Sunday after they are assigned. The third component of the final project is due at 11:59 p.m. on the date of the scheduled final. (Note that this does not mean that there is final exam for this course. This is just the due date for the Power BI assignment). The official due dates are posted in the “weekly materials” page for the week that they are due.\nLate assignments will be accepted with a standard penalty of three percentage points per day that they are turned in after the official due date. No exceptions will be made to this policy.\nIf you are having a personal or medical emergency and are wondering what to do, start by referencing this FAQ published by GW Student Life. Or just reach out to the CARE Team at gwcares@gwu.edu. For further information about different types of support available to you, see the course support page.\nWhile I will always try to be a source of support to my students, please note that for privacy reasons, the Provost has asked that faculty do not attempt to verify personal or medical emergencies themselves.\n\n\nMake-ups\nThere are no makeups. Please see the late assignments policy above.\n\n\nAttendance\nThis is an in-person class and you are expected to attend. While there is no formal attendance requirement, it is a proven fact that students who attend class tend to perform better on exams and assignments. Also, the instructor will not provide “makeup sessions” to go over material that was missed due to absence.\n\n\nGrading scale\n\n\n\nRange\nLetter Grade\n\n\n\n\n94-100\nA\n\n\n90-93\nA-\n\n\n87-89\nB+\n\n\n84-86\nB\n\n\n80-83\nB-\n\n\n77-79\nC+\n\n\n74-76\nC\n\n\n70-73\nC-\n\n\n67-69\nD+\n\n\n64-66\nD\n\n\n60-63\nD-\n\n\n<59\nF\n\n\n\n\n\nClass recordings\nAll classes will be recorded. Recordings will be posted on the course Blackboard site.\n\n\nLateness\nPlease come to class on time. It is distracting to me and to other students when you enter the room late.\n\n\nLaptops and cell phones\nPlease put away your cell phones during class. It is fine to use computers to take notes, but you should refrain from checking social media and email.\n\n\nDiversity in the classroom\nWe want to make sure that everyone has an opportunity to participate in class and to get the most out of their learning experience at GW. Moreover, we all benefit from a diversity of views in the classroom. Therefore, please be respectful of other people’s views and be mindful of when others are trying to participate.\n\n\nLearning Needs\nPlease let me know if you have any special needs or learning requirements and so that I can accommodate them.\n\n\nEmail\nI try to respond to emails within 24 hours except on weekends. It is usually preferred to talk to me in person, however, either after class or during office hours.\n\n\nFood\nStudents are permitted to eat light snacks, but please refrain from bringing sugary drinks, coffee or large, odiferous meals."
